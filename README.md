## React TypeScript Starter

The idea of this project is to make things easier by creating a new React project (using Typescript) that makes requests to a backend running in Node.js. It will have a JWT authentication system, it will have a REST API created with Express and will use Sequelize as ORM for a PostgreSQL database.
